# rconcr

Client for the RCON (Remote CONsole) protocol implemented in Crystal.

This Protocol is used to access a remote console on game servers. The implementation
has been tested with Minecraft server, but should work with Source-compatible RCON
servers as well.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     rconcr:
       github: straight-shoota/rconcr
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "rconcr"

RCON::Client.open(address, host, password) do |client|
  response = client.command "say Hello World from RCON!"
  if response
    RCON.colorize(STDOUT, response)
    puts
  else
    abort "Server closed connection"
  end
end
```
